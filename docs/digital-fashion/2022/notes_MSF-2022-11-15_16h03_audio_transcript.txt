# Summary
The Metaverse Standards Forum Digital Fashion Wearables for Avatars working group held a meeting to discuss various topics related to the development of open source systems for fashion variables and avatar creation. The main focus of the discussion was on exploring existing landscapes, defining systems for interoperable fashion variables, and conducting experiments to improve performance and quality.

# Action Items
1. Investigate existing open source systems for fashion variables and avatars.
2. Define systems for interoperable fashion variables.
3. Conduct experiments to improve performance and quality of avatar creation.
4. Create a shared space between the working groups to facilitate collaboration and learning.
5. Set up a Wiki on the Forum portal to document progress and share activities with the group.
6. Invite contributors to join the group and participate in discussions and experiments.

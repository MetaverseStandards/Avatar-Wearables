# Digital Fashion Wearables for Avatars Metaverse Standards Forum Meeting Summary

## Overview
The meeting was focused on the creation of a flow chart and document to guide the group's work. The goal is to reduce fragmentation between standards and practitioners for avatar wearables, including understanding different layering systems and defining a system for interoperable fashion variables. The group discussed creating recommendations rather than creating a system themselves, as well as encouraging communication between practitioners with key technologies.

## Action Items
1. Create a set of recommendations for relevant standards for this.
2. Encourage communication between practitioners with key technologies to support variable use cases.
3. Define a system for interoperable fashion variables.
4. Gather guidelines, resources for optimization targets based on various platform documentation.
5. Review and finalize the charter document and submit it as a working group.
6. Set up a github issue for suggestions and comments.
7. Create a virtual war room to make notes more easily digestible and accessible.
8. Schedule the next meeting for July 10th, by weekly.
9. Encourage all group members to review the document and add more comments.

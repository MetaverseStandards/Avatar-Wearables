[00:00:00] **Introduction**

* The meeting is being recorded.
* Participants introduce themselves.
* The purpose of the meeting is to discuss interoperability in the context of characters and avatars in the metaverse.
* The meeting will be divided into two parts: a presentation by Hideaki Eguchi from VRMC, followed by an open discussion.

[00:12:45] **Presentation by Hideaki Eguchi**

* Hideaki Eguchi presents the concept of VRM, which is a standard for facial expressions in virtual reality.
* VRM provides an API that allows developers to access and manipulate facial features based on predefined expressions.
* The goal of VRM is to enable interoperability between different VR platforms and applications.
* Hideaki Eguchi shares the link to the VRM documentation for further reference.

[00:21:56] **Open Discussion**

* Participants discuss the challenges of implementing facial expressions in virtual reality characters.
* Some participants prefer using texture offsets, while others use shape keys or brand shapes to change character expressions.
* The need for a standardized approach to implement facial expressions is highlighted.
* Hideaki Eguchi explains that VRM was created as a solution to this problem, providing a common interface for developers to access and manipulate facial features.
* Participants share their experiences with different VR platforms and applications related to characters and avatars in the metaverse.

[00:34:12] **Next Steps**

* The meeting participants agree on the importance of creating a charter document for interoperable characters and avatars.
* A timeline is proposed, with meetings every 2 weeks until the end of May.
* Participants suggest inviting representatives from different companies to present their use cases in future meetings.
* The meeting participants are encouraged to join the Metaverse Standards Forum Discord channel for real-time communication and collaboration.
* The link to the charter proposal document is shared, along with instructions on how to access it through the Metaverse Standards Forum portal.

[00:42:15] **Questions and Answers**

* RÃ©mi Arnaud asks about the future direction of the initiative and how it will be published as a standard.
* Mike Roberts explains that the goal is not to create a single standard, but rather to summarize different approaches from existing standards development organizations (Sdos).
* The importance of understanding the different use cases for characters and avatars in the metaverse is emphasized.
* Participants discuss the concept of taxonomy and its relevance to interoperability in the context of characters and avatars.
* It is suggested that inviting experts from the industry who are already working on taxonomies could provide valuable insights for the initiative.

[00:51:32] **Conclusion**

* The meeting participants express their gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the discussion.
* Future meetings will be scheduled, and participants are encouraged to invite representatives from other companies to contribute their expertise.
* The recording of the meeting is stopped, allowing participants to engage in water cooler discussions.

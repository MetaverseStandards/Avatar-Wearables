**Transcript of the Interoperable Characters and Avatars Metaverse Standards Forum Meeting on 2023-02-07**

[00:00:00] **Introduction**

* The meeting is being recorded.
* Participants introduce themselves.
* The purpose of the meeting is to discuss interoperability in the context of characters and avatars in the metaverse.
* The meeting will be divided into two parts: a presentation by Hideaki Eguchi from VRMC, followed by an open discussion.

[00:12:45] **Presentation by Hideaki Eguchi**

* Hideaki Eguchi presents the concept of VRM, which is a standard for facial expressions in virtual reality.
* VRM provides an API that allows developers to access and manipulate facial features based on predefined expressions.
* The goal of VRM is to enable interoperability between different VR platforms and applications.
* Hideaki Eguchi shares the link to the VRM documentation for further reference.

[00:21:56] **Open Discussion**

* Participants discuss the challenges of implementing facial expressions in virtual reality characters.
* Some participants prefer using texture offsets, while others use shape keys or brand shapes to change character expressions.
* The need for a standardized approach to implement facial expressions is highlighted.
* Hideaki Eguchi explains that VRM was created as a solution to this problem, providing a common interface for developers to access and manipulate facial features.
* Participants share their experiences with different VR platforms and applications related to characters and avatars in the metaverse.

[00:34:12] **Next Steps**

* The meeting participants agree on the importance of creating a charter document for interoperable characters and avatars.
* A timeline is proposed, with meetings every 2 weeks until the end of May.
* Participants suggest inviting representatives from different companies to present their use cases in future meetings.
* The meeting participants are encouraged to join the Metaverse Standards Forum Discord channel for real-time communication and collaboration.
* The link to the charter proposal document is shared, along with instructions on how to access it through the Metaverse Standards Forum portal.

[00:42:15] **Questions and Answers**

* RÃ©mi Arnaud asks about the future direction of the initiative and how it will be published as a standard.
* Mike Roberts explains that the goal is not to create a single standard, but rather to summarize different approaches from existing standards development organizations (Sdos).
* The importance of understanding the different use cases for characters and avatars in the metaverse is emphasized.
* Participants discuss the concept of taxonomy and its relevance to interoperability in the context of characters and avatars.
* It is suggested that inviting experts from the industry who are already working on taxonomies could provide valuable insights for the initiative.

[00:51:32] **Conclusion**

* The meeting participants express their gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the discussion.
* Future meetings will be scheduled, and participants are encouraged to invite representatives from other companies to contribute their expertise.
* The recording of the meeting is stopped, allowing participants to engage in water cooler discussions.

# Interoperable Avatars Characters Group 2023-05-09

------------------------------

The following is a transcript of the meeting between Linden Lab, Andrew Kertesz (Mojo Linden), and the Interop Characters Avatars Metaverse Standards Forum. The discussion revolves around the challenges of interoperability in virtual worlds, particularly with regard to avatar appearance and animations.

Andrew Kertesz begins by discussing the challenges of moving other people's avatars into Second Life and the idea of moving Second Life avatars into other worlds. He mentions that they have been working on a mobile application and successfully implemented their rendering aspects in Unity, but it was a lot of work to move coordinate systems and retarget everything.

Andrew then presents three ideas for dealing with interoperability:
1. Resampling avatars to reduce the number of polygons, making them compatible with other environments like Roadblocks or other games. This would require retargeting and adopting a new clothing system.
2. Adopting a new standard in Second Life that could potentially serve as a bridge for people to come into Second Life.
3. Considering whether avatars actually need to be portable, and if not, creating a convention where users can associate their presence with different worlds.

Andrew also mentions that they have been working on adopting Chrono standards and GLTF materials in particular. He shows some examples of the new lighting models and reflection probes they are implementing.

David Kaplan, from the University of Southern California, shares his perspective on the metaverse as an upgrade to the Internet. He believes that interoperability is crucial for serving a variety of needs and growing as a community rather than relying on a single entity. David suggests that standards like USD (Universal Scene Description) are rapidly becoming adopted in the industry.

Dave Parks, from Linden Lab, confirms that they are going all-in on GLTF implementation. They currently have support for materials and plan to expand their support in the future.

The meeting concludes with a reminder of the next few meetings and an invitation to contribute suggestions for the charter creation process. The forum is encouraged to use discord for small conversations, but the content will be public.

**Participants:**

1. Hideaki Eguchi (VRMC)
2. Mehdi Hamadou (Siemens)
3. Hirya Geichi (VRMC)
4. Zeno Rogue (Interop Characters Avatars Metaverse Standards Forum)
5. Arman (Union Avatars)

**Summary:**

The meeting started with a brief introduction of the participants and their roles in the Interop Characters Avatars Metaverse Standards Forum. The main focus of the discussion was on the use cases for the metaverse standards forum. The first use case discussed was the "Chatbot" scenario, where a character chat bot interacts with users to provide information or assistance. The second use case discussed was the "Virtual Singers and Bandmates" scenario, which involves virtual musicians performing live shows in a virtual environment. The third use case discussed was the "Non-Player Character (NPC)" scenario, which focuses on the interaction between non-human characters and users within a digital or virtual environment.

The participants shared their thoughts and feedback on each use case. They discussed the challenges and opportunities associated with each scenario, as well as potential improvements to enhance user engagement and interaction. The meeting also touched upon the importance of considering both humanoid and non-humanoid characters in the NPC scenario. The participants agreed that it would be beneficial to include examples for both types of characters.

The meeting concluded with a discussion on the process of building detailed use cases, as well as the upcoming educational meetings for other working groups within the Interop Characters Avatars Metaverse Standards Forum. The participants were encouraged to stay engaged and participate in the off-meeting discussions if they had any questions or comments.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. The "Chatbot" scenario focuses on providing information or assistance through a character chat bot, with limited interaction between users and the environment. The participants suggested adding capabilities for the Chatbot to interact with objects in the environment, such as showing how to use a product or explaining the reasoning behind an artist's work.

2. The "Virtual Singers and Bandmates" scenario involves virtual musicians performing live shows in a virtual environment. The participants discussed the benefits of this use case, including enabling imaginative characters to perform live shows, allowing deceased musicians to perform shows, and enabling musicians to perform live in multiple venues at once.

3. The "Non-Player Character (NPC)" scenario focuses on the interaction between non-human characters and users within a digital or virtual environment. The participants agreed that it would be beneficial to include examples for both humanoid and non-humanoid characters in this scenario.

4. The process of building detailed use cases involves working with relevant stakeholders and members, curating content, reviewing the content by Chas and members, and finalizing the use case once approved by the Chaz and members.

5. The Interop Characters Avatars Metaverse Standards Forum will be giving educational meetings to other working groups within the forum, with the next meeting scheduled for April 22nd and June 5th.

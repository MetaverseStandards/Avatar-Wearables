Welcome to the MSF exploratory group focused on Digital Fashion! We are mainly exploring the use case where users can try on digital wearables in a virtual fitting room and leave with a new outfit that's ready to show such in as many places as possible.

## 📅 Calendar

Meetups are **bi-weekly** every Tuesday night at 8pm EST, calendar and event information can be found in the [MSF portal](https://portal.metaverse-standards.org/wg/Fashion_Wearables/dashboard) for this group. If you wish to reach us live, join the public [MSF discord](https://discord.gg/MVsqBDNn) and hop into the wearables-for-avatars [channel](https://discord.com/channels/985632346386595930/1070722884173041765).

We pay special attention to opportunities for cooperation between multiple initiatives to increase synergy and reduce duplication of effort, gaps, fragmentation and confusion, for the good of the industry. Here are a few groups that have a shared interest to avatar / wearable interop:

- [**Interoperable Characters/Avatars EG**](https://portal.metaverse-standards.org/wg/Characters_Avatars/workgroup)
  - Interoperable avatars and wearables are very closely related topics
- [**Open Metaverse Interoperability group**](https://omigroup.org/)
  - Check out the work the [glTF extensions](https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions) meetup is doing
- [**M3 Avatar Interop Group**](https://github.com/M3-org/avatar-interop)
  - Weekly events and occasional research field trips related to avatar / wearable interop

## 🥅 Goals


> The Metaverse Standards Forum is enabling a new level of industry coordination that is generating insights into the metaverse landscape—including what interoperability standards will have the greatest impact, and what business opportunities they will create. The Forum is NOT another SDO, but is enabling diverse SDOs to gather input, share progress, and cooperate with industry to identify needs and next steps to encourage, influence, and accelerate the evolution of effective, timely, open metaverse standards.

- Generate insights on digital fashion interoperability including clothing (with a layering system), shoes, hats, and accessories
- Survey the current landscape of existing file formats for storing avatars and related assets
- Generating use cases and requirements for avatar customisation
- Defining logic for a wearables system including dress up, dress down, and replace options

> We're also interested in an open source avatar validation tool for reliable import and export from popular authoring tools such as Blender.

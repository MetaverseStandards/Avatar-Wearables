Welcome to the MSF exploratory group focused on Digital Fashion! We are mainly exploring the use case where users can try on digital wearables in a virtual fitting room and leave with a new outfit that's ready to show such in as many places as possible.

## 📅 Calendar

Meetups are **bi-weekly** every Tuesday night at 8pm EST, calendar and event information can be found in the [MSF portal](https://portal.metaverse-standards.org/wg/Fashion_Wearables/dashboard) for this group. If you wish to reach us live, join the public [MSF discord](https://discord.gg/MVsqBDNn) and hop into the wearables-for-avatars [channel](https://discord.com/channels/985632346386595930/1070722884173041765).

We pay special attention to opportunities for cooperation between multiple initiatives to increase synergy and reduce duplication of effort, gaps, fragmentation and confusion, for the good of the industry. Here are a few groups that have a shared interest to avatar / wearable interop:

- [**Interoperable Characters/Avatars EG**](https://portal.metaverse-standards.org/wg/Characters_Avatars/workgroup)
  - Interoperable avatars and wearables are very closely related topics
- [**Open Metaverse Interoperability group**](https://omigroup.org/)
  - Check out the work the [glTF extensions](https://github.com/omigroup/gltf-extensions) meetup is doing
- [**M3 Avatar Interop Group**](https://github.com/M3-org/avatar-interop)
  - Weekly events and occasional research field trips related to avatar / wearable interop

## 🥅 Goals

As with any MSF Exploratory Group our goal is to identify and build consensus on what pragmatic projects and activities can best progress interoperability in a particular domain, and then capturing those insights into a draft Working Group Charter. The more short-term deliverables that drive well-defined interoperability benefits the better.
 

- Survey the current landscape of existing file formats for storing avatars and related assets https://github.com/MetaverseStandards/Avatar-Wearables/issues/2
- Generating use cases and requirements for avatar customisation https://github.com/MetaverseStandards/Avatar-Wearables/issues/3
- Generate insights on digital fashion interoperability including clothing (with a layering system), shoes, hats, and accessories https://github.com/MetaverseStandards/Avatar-Wearables/issues/4
- Defining logic for a wearables system including dress up, dress down, and replace options https://github.com/MetaverseStandards/Avatar-Wearables/issues/4
- Scope out an open source avatar validation tool for reliable import and export from popular authoring tools such as Blender https://github.com/MetaverseStandards/Avatar-Wearables/issues/7

## ✍ Contributing

Current agenda tasks are posted in GitHub issues: https://github.com/MetaverseStandards/avatar-wearables/issues


**Our activities**

- Make stuff: Many of us have a passion for creating avatars and wearables, hence why we're here!
- Research events that serve as testing, learning, and promotion of avatar wearable interop
- Producing clear communications in the form of notes, videos, blog posts, and so on


**How can you help?**

- First, jump into the [discord](https://discord.gg/MVsqBDNn) and introduce yourself! We're in the [#avatar-wearables](https://discord.com/channels/985632346386595930/1021816827787083776) channel
- Participate in our meetups and help take notes, we're fans of [markdown](https://hackmd.io/) and [infinite canvas tools](https://infinitecanvas.tools/)
- Work on a project that is missing, or missing in the right shape, in the open metaverse community
- Promote the group to an audience or member who might be interested in helping out the mission
